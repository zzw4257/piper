"""The executor's happens-before contract, stated instead of implied.

`DagExecutor.run` dispatches on exact `task_type` and finds its predecessors the
same way. A comm kind that is dispatched but missing from the consumer lookups is
therefore skipped in silence, and the consumer falls through to whatever its
`else` branch does -- reading the wrong inputs with no error. That happened
during this project: `TP_COMM` had a dispatch arm before the four predecessor
lookups knew about it (notes/log.md F19's lead-in, and the fix in the Stage C
commit).

These tests make the contract explicit. Adding a comm kind now fails here until
it is classified and, if it feeds compute, wired into the lookups.
